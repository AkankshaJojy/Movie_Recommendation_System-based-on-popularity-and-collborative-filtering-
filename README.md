# Movie_Recommendation_System-based-on-popularity-and-collaborative-filtering-

This project is a movie recommendation system that suggests movies to users based on two main approaches: popularity-based filtering and collaborative filtering. The system leverages user interaction data to provide personalized movie recommendations, enhancing the user's viewing experience by suggesting films they are likely to enjoy.

Features
Popularity-Based Filtering:

Recommends movies based on their overall popularity.
Popularity is determined by metrics such as ratings, number of ratings, and views.
Great for new users with no prior interaction history.
Collaborative Filtering:

Recommends movies based on the preferences of similar users.
Uses user-item interaction data to find patterns and similarities between users.
Provides more personalized recommendations as it considers the user's unique preferences and viewing history.

Technology Stack
Python: The core programming language used for developing the system.
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
NumPy: For numerical computations.
scikit-learn: For implementing collaborative filtering algorithms.
